## About Me

Hello! I'm an entrepreneur and manager with over 13 years of experience leading businesses and teams. I am currently immersed in an exciting career transition into the world of Technology and Software.

* **Backend:** Java, Basic JPA/JDBC
* **Databases:** Basic MySQL
* **Tools and Environments:** Git, GitHub, Eclipse IDE
* **Data Analysis & Cloud:** Basic Power BI, AWS Fundamentals, Basic Oracle Cloud and Azure AI (in training).

## My Current Path

I am committed to a structured and continuous learning process to strengthen my technical profile:

* I am currently in the **2nd year of the Computer Science Degree** at the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco (UNPSJB).
* I am enrolled in the prestigious **Oracle Next Education (ONE)** training program, aiming to specialize in Back-End with Java.

## What Am I Looking For?
